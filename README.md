#### PROBLEM STATEMENT :
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous 
shipwrecks in history. On April 15th, 1952, during her 
maiden voyage, the widely considered "unsinkable" RMS 
Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. 
Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for 
everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 
2224 passengers and crew. In this project, we build a 
predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts 
of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger 
data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).


#### BENEFIT TO SOCIETY :
It will prevent further mishaps from happening
It will help societies to design better ships
And prevent causes in the working whole 
performing a task.

#### TECHNIQUES :

- Tools – Google Colab
- Data and Training 
- Exploratory Data Analysis,
- Decision Tree Classifiers, 
- KNN Classifier, SVC 

#### INFERENCE :
Such disasters could be prevented if better 
engineered
The possibility of having a greater dataset 
could largely impact and improve the model 
efficiency and should be implemented in more 
advanced algorithms

#### FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS :
Future enhancement could be that it can be use a 
better dataset for more algorithms which in turn 
could help structure the model better
It could use neural networks for better and faster 
output
